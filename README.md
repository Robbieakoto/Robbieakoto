# Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Nice to meet you!

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about contributing to open-source projects, creating solutions to people's problem, and community building. Some technologies I enjoy working with JavaScript, GraphQL, Laravel but willing to learn new technologies. I recently discovered a serveless technology that makes your data accessible easy over GraphQl called https://hasura.io/. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on project ideas especially startupsðŸ¤—.

When Iâ€™m not coding, designing or writing, Iâ€™m the best DJ youâ€™ll ever meetðŸ˜ƒ. In other words, I love music. I'm also currently available for work. You can find all the work experiences and professional information on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbieakoto/).
