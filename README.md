# Hi there ðŸ‘‹,I'm Roberta .


I'm a software engineer who is passionate about contributing to open-sourceprojects, creating solutions to people's problem, and community building. Some technologies I enjoy working with include JavaScript, GraphQL, Laravel. I recently discovered a serveless technology that makes your data accessible easy over GraphQl called https://hasura.io/. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on project ideas especially startups.
