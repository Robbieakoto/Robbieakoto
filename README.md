I'm a software engineer who is passionate about contributing to open-sourceprojects, creating solutions to people's problem, and community building. Some technologies I enjoy working with JavaScript, GraphQL, Laravel and digging into new technologies. I recently discovered a serveless technology that makes your data accessible easy over GraphQl called https://hasura.io/. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on project ideas especially startupsðŸ¤—.

When Iâ€™m not coding, designing  or writing, Iâ€™m the best DJ youâ€™ll ever meetðŸ˜ƒ. In other words, I love music. I'm also currently available for work.
